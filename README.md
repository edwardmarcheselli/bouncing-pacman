# Bouncing Pacman

Overview:
This javascript app will generate a pacman image every time you press the create pacman button.  Once you start the game the pacman will bounce around the inside of your screen at random.  You may add additional pacmen once you have started the simulation.

How To Run:
Drag the index.html file into your browser. Press "Add Pacman" to generate Pacmen and "Start Game" to start the simulation.

Future Improvements:
1 add a background to the app
2 add different colored pacmen
